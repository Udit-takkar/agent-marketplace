## The Graph Protocol Integration

The project uses The Graph protocol for efficient indexing and querying of blockchain data, particularly for scam detection and pattern analysis. This integration is currently under development and includes:

### Subgraph Components

- **Schema**: Defines entities for scam reports, evidence, patterns, and addresses
- **Smart Contract**: ScamDetector contract for on-chain report submission
- **Mappings**: Transform blockchain events into structured data

### Use Cases

1. **Scam Reporting**

   - Submit and track scam reports
   - Provide evidence for reported scams
   - Community voting system
   - Reporter reputation tracking

2. **Pattern Detection**

   - Index and store detected scam patterns
   - Track pattern frequency and evolution
   - Calculate risk scores for addresses

3. **Historical Analysis**
   - Query historical scam data
   - Analyze pattern trends
   - Track repeat offenders

### Current Status

The Graph integration is partially implemented with:

- Basic schema design
- Smart contract implementation
- Subgraph manifest
- Service layer for frontend integration

Pending implementation:

- Complete subgraph deployment
- Frontend components for scam reporting
- Integration with existing risk analysis
- Community voting system
- Pattern analysis dashboard
